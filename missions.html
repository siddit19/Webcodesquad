                <b style="font-size: 1.2em;">1.)Lucy Mission:-</b>
                Lucy will be the first space mission to study the Trojans. The mission takes its name from the
                fossilized human ancestor (called “Lucy” by her discoverers) whose skeleton provided unique insight into
                humanity's evolution. Likewise, the Lucy mission will revolutionize our knowledge of planetary origins
                and the formation of the solar system.Lucy will launch in October 2021 and, with boosts from Earth's
                gravity, will complete a 12-year journey to eight different asteroids — a Main Belt asteroid and seven
                Trojans, four of which are members of “two-for-the-price-of-one” binary systems. Lucy’s complex path
                will take it to both clusters of Trojans and give us our first close-up view of all three major types of
                bodies in the swarms (so-called C-, P- and D-types).

                Description: Artemis I will be the first integrated test of NASA’s deep space exploration systems: the
                Orion spacecraft, Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and the ground systems at Kennedy Space Center in
                Cape Canaveral, Florida. The first in a series of increasingly complex missions, Artemis I will be an
                uncrewed flight test that will provide a foundation for human deep space exploration, and demonstrate
                our commitment and capability to extend human existence to the Moon and beyond. During this flight, the
                spacecraft will travel 280,000 miles from Earth, thousands of miles beyond the Moon over the course of
                about a three-week mission. Orion will stay in space longer than any ship for astronauts has done
                without docking to a space station and return home faster and hotter than ever before.

                <b>3.) NASA's SpaceX Crew-3 Mission to the International Space Station:-</b>
                NASA’s SpaceX Crew-3 mission will launch four astronauts aboard a Crew Dragon spacecraft on a Falcon 9
                rocket from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center to the International Space Station. Assigned to
                the mission are NASA astronauts Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, and Kayla Barron, and European Space Agency
                astronaut Matthias Maurer.

                NASA and SpaceX leadership provided an update Oct. 6 as part of the agency’s Crew-3 mission to the
                International Space Station – the third crew rotation flight that will carry an international crew of
                four astronauts on a science expedition to the microgravity laboratory as part of the Commercial Crew
                Program.
                Missions teams are targeting no earlier than April 15, 2022, for the launch of NASA’s SpaceX Crew-4
                mission to the space station for a six-month science mission aboard the microgravity laboratory.

                Radar Imaging Satellite-1A, or RISAT-1A, is a planned remote sensing satellite as a follow on to RISAT-1
                and with similar configuration. The satellite is being developed by Indian Space Research Organisation
                (ISRO) and it will be 6th in series of RISAT satellites. It will be a land based mission with primary
                application in terrain mapping and analysis of land, ocean and water surface for soil moisture.

                Gaganyaan is an Indian crewed orbital spacecraft intended to be the formative spacecraft of the Indian
                Human Spaceflight Programme. The spacecraft is being designed to carry three people, and a planned
                upgraded version will be equipped with rendezvous and docking capability. In its maiden crewed mission,
                Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)'s largely autonomous 5.3 t (12,000 lb) capsule will orbit the
                Earth at 400 km (250 mi) altitude for up to seven days with a two or three-person crew on board.

                The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission is a joint project between NASA and ISRO to co-develop and launch a dual-frequency synthetic aperture radar on an Earth observation satellite. The satellite will be the first radar imaging satellite to use dual frequencies. It will be used for remote sensing, to observe and understand natural processes on Earth. For example, its left-facing instruments will study the Antarctic cryosphere With a total cost estimated at US$1.5 billion, NISAR is likely to be the world's most expensive Earth-imaging satellite.The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar, or NISAR satellite, will use advanced radar imaging to map the elevation of Earth's land and ice masses 4 to 6 times a month at resolutions of 5 to 10 meters.It is designed to observe and measure some of the planet's most complex natural processes, including ecosystem disturbances, ice-sheet collapse, and natural hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes and landslides.
