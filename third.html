            Mars-bound landers and rovers may not need to undergo quite such stringent cleaning procedures as they previously have before leaving Earth, a committee evaluating planetary protection measures has found.<br>

Planetary protection is the art of trying to make sure that Earth germs don't establish a foothold on other worlds and vice versa.<br> Since the 1980s, in the name of preventing such an invasion, spacecraft bound for places that scientists think may be hospitable to life as we know it must undergo rigorous cleaning procedures before blasting off. But when it comes to robots bound for the surface of Mars, NASA may be able to loosen its rules, scientists explain in a 55-page report developed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine at NASA's request and released on Thursday (Oct. 7).<br>
