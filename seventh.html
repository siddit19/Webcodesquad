            Two astronauts expected to fly on early missions of Boeing's crew capsule will instead ride to orbit with SpaceX, NASA announced today (Oct. 6).<br><br>

The agency has reassigned astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada to SpaceX's Crew-5 mission, which is expected to launch toward the International Space Station no earlier than the fall of 2022. <br><br>

Mann and Cassada had both been training on Boeing's CST-100 Starliner capsule, Mann in preparation for the spacecraft's first crewed test flight to the orbiting lab and Cassada for Starliner's first operational mission. <br><br>
